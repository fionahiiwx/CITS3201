1. Create databases (One for source db one for final db in pgAdmin)
2. Check all the data csv excel that at the end of the rows don't have redundant words (like Windows...), remove them
3. Change all occurence of 'no data' and '..' in the excel file (or can do this in postgresql later)
4. Upload src data to docker
docker cp "C:/path/to/data_file.csv" pgdb:/tmp/data_file.csv
('pgdb' can double check it is that by using 'docker ps' in vscode)
Successfully copied 25.1kB to pgdb:/tmp/Economic_data.csv (good to go)
5. Create tables
CREATE table_name (
	var1 type
)
6. Populate table 
- by postgres (I used this)
	COPY table_name FROM '/tmp/data_file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
- by Import data (this not sure)
	'Object Explorer>SrcDB>Schemas>public>Tables>table_name(RightClick)>Import/Export data'
(Make sure u have 7 populated tables by now)
